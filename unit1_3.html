<h3>3.1</h3>

<p>
    In order to execute design features I initially attempted to use my pre-existing knowledge and logic, but quickly found myself floundering and decided to recourse to google. Through google I came across coding ‘encyclopaedias’ such as w3schools. Unfortunately, the formatting of their CSS examples was inconsistent with the format we had to use for our websites, so I created a ‘scrapbook’ file to experiment with different elements and parameters to deduce what the effects were. Going through this process helped me to learn much more thoroughly *why* certain things worked, as opposed to simply copy-and-pasting sections of code from the internet, so I am grateful for that learning curve.
    <br>
    <br>
    With the benefit of hindsight, I can estimate that it may have been more efficient to have set aside time at the very start to research and learn how to use CSS and HTML to build a website. I suppose I very much encountered the issue of ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’. Or rather, the more knowledge I gained, the more I gained insight into the vastness of ‘what I don’t know’ about the intricacies of CSS and web design.
    <br>
    <br>
    I think for projects such as games, a collaborative approach works well. My personal feeling is that building a website is a much more inwardly focused process therefore better suited to an individual. Unless the main tasks divided amongst a team were content-writing, I think that having several people designing their own pages would ultimately make for an end product that lacked consistency and coherence. However, it could have been useful to have a team of people each tasked with researching and developing functional code for different elements of the website, for subsequent integration into the whole e.g. one person on the menu, another person on dynamic backgrounds, another on flex boxes, etc.

    As I mentioned previously, it is important to take regular breaks when working alone, which is something I struggle to remember to do! On the other hand, the way in which I work means that I have very good sustained focus for complex and/or tedious tasks - and I believe coding is both those things simultaneously. 
    <br>
    Good practices that help me to focus include:
    <ol>
        <li class=plainlist>I make sure that I am facing a blank wall so I am not distracted by visual clutter.</li>
        <li class=plainlist>Phone is out of sight and set to ‘do not disturb’.</li> 
        <li class=plainlist>Listening to minimal electronic/ techno music while working, as the repetitive nature and absence of vocals helps me to focus better than other types of music.</li>
        <li class=plainlist>Keeping a bottle of water on my desk. Even if I don’t always remember to eat at least I stay hydrated, which improves mental clarity.</li>
    </ol>

    I found myself getting a little frustrated at how often my focus was broken by notifications from the Slack channel. I kept these on as there was often helpful information, or requests to enter Zoom meetings, posted in the ‘general’ channel. Unfortunately there was also a lot of irrelevant or personal chatter posted in the ‘general’ channel, which was originally only intended for course-relevant discussions. I did not feel that I could ask others to move discussions to the ‘random’ channel as I felt it would not be well received. Perhaps if I were to use Slack again for a project I would ask for the boundaries to be set a little clearer, in the interests of improving everyone’s focus.

    As someone who is usually very active, I found it hard spending the whole day sitting down, and due to the time of year by the time the working day was over my usual training spaces were closed. Although I did take time to stretch most days, I think next time I have an intensive digital project I will aim to create a routine that factors in short runs throughout the day. I think this would help to clear my head and improve productivity by boosting blood flow, increasing oxygen uptake, and even just having a change of scenery.

<p>
    I find it useful to set out with a particular focus. If I review my website and find elements to improve, I note these down and then go through them one by one. If the amendment is an easy fix e.g. increasing top-margin, I do this in the actual CSS file linked to that page. If it is more of an overhaul, I trial improvements in a ‘scrapbook’ page. One method I have found useful is to trial different versions of the same feature (e.g. menu) by entering different segments of code into the scrapbook and ‘commenting out’ all but one. Sometimes if I do not understand why a particular feature does/doesn’t work, I try commenting out lines of code that I think will affect it to gauge the impact. This scrapbooking practice has proven a useful method of deepening my working knowledge of coding languages and testing digital solutions in a low-risk manner.
