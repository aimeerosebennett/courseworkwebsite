    As you can see, my website has 8 pages. The Home page simply consists of a navigation bar on the left hand side (without page indicator), floral background, and my name, which is illuminated blue and red when the mouse hovers over it as a little hidden surprise. I think of this page as a ‘welcome’ mat before a (series of) doors; the guest can choose which door (page) they want to open and when, and as such I have not bombarded them without any extra information before they seek it out. 
    <br>
    <br>
    All subsequent pages feature the same left-side vertical navigation bar with an additional navigation indicator bar that lets the guest always know which page they are on due to its static position. The position of this is aligned with the top of the hover-button for each menu item. All content pages also feature a standardised set of heading bars, the backgrounds of which form a gradient of shades of grey which complements the monochrome backgrounds. Each section of writing is enclosed within a translucent white background and interspersed with separated headings, which helps to break up the content, making it easier to read. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The ‘About Me’ page also features an image of myself performing aerial rope for context. Many people have misconceptions about what terms like ‘contemporary circus’ and ‘aerial rope’ mean, so I included an image to illustrate. Out of the various images I could have chosen I picked that particular one for its simplicity and colour scheme, which I felt best complemented the aesthetic of my website.
    <br>
    <br>
    The references page is a guide to which resources I accessed for information, with the title of the publication acting as a hyperlink that navigates to its source, opening in a new tab.

    Intellectual property laws protect the rights of creators of original works. This commonly known to cover work under the general umbrella of ‘Art’ such as music scores, poetry, painting, and photography. However, in contemporary times it also covers ‘original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases’ <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[7]</a>. Copyright for a piece of work automatically exists as soon as the author completes the work and protects it from use without the author’s permission, regardless of whether or not there is a copyright symbol © attached to it.
   <br>
   <br>
    When selecting content for a website it is important to be mindful of copyright laws surrounding use of images, for example, which is why it is recommended to either seek to obtain permission from the owner of an image, or use websites such as unsplash.com which contain thousands of images that are certifiably free for anyone to use.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is illegal to intentionally copy the content of a website, and to copy the design of a website. This includes source code, logos, and ‘patented colour schemes’ especially design elements strongly associated with brands <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[8]</a>. Current copyright laws do not prevent website developers from recreating parts of designs using custom code, but it would be an infringement of copyright to use sections of another web designer’s work directly without alteration.

    People with reading difficulties such as dyslexia may find it difficult to read long, unbroken passages of text. Websites with plenty of images and concise text are more accessible for people with dyslexia. Content that is presented in video format with a narrator providing information audibly, works even better for dyslexia. Videos with narration are also suitable for people with visual impairments who may struggle to read text, and if narrated videos have Closed Captions they are also accessible for people with auditory impairments. There are now many web browser extensions called ‘Screen Readers’ that use text-to-speech technology in order to convert written content into audio, which helps to make the internet a more equitably accessible resource. As people become more aware of the need to make internet content more accessible, image descriptions are increasingly common (see About Me section for an example). Screen readers can also provide information in Braille, if the user has an external hardware device known as a ‘refreshable Braille display’<a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[9]</a>.

    In general, the most appropriate filetypes for websites are the ones that are most easily accessible - i.e. can be easily viewed and download by the majority of, regardless of their operating system, and without requiring extra software. When using photographic content on websites, it is recommended to use compressed .jpeg/ .jpg file extensions so that high-resolution images do not slow down the website’s functioning. However for logos, a .png format is preferable, and the logo should have a transparent background for maximum versatility and professional appearance. If a website user is given the option to download a document, it is best that the document be in .pdf format so that the content cannot be edited. Audio is best uploaded in .mp3 format, short animations in .gif, and video in .mp4 <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[10]</a>.
