<h3>Background</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
    Aimee is a professional contemporary circus artist and teacher. 
    She graduated in 2020 with a 1st class degree in Contemporary Circus and Physical Theatre from Circomedia, Bristol. 
    Her main disciplines are dynamic rope (Corde Lisse) and partner acrobatics.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    She has over 4 years experience working professionally as a teacher and performer. Performance credits include: (UK) Jackson’s Lane, Port Eliot festival, Circus Montini; and overseas, international circus festivals such as CIRCa Auch, and Gare au Gorille in France. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In response to the displacement of live performance during the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown, Aimee self-produced five site-specific short films exploring themes of isolation through circus, theatre, spoken word, and dance.

She is surrounded by darkness, except for four theatre lights. She is hanging from one hand with her knees tucked up to her chest, pushing the rope out in front of her with her free hand.

<h3>Why Code Nation?</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
    I have always enjoyed intellectual challenges such as learning new languages and solving puzzles.   
    In contemporary circus this takes the form of spatial reasoning and application of physics to create new tricks. However, with all training spaces and venues closed, I applied to receive Universal Credit until the sector recovers. 
    When my Universal Credit work coach told me about the opportunity to enrol on a 3-week coding course I jumped at the opportunity, and it has been even better than anticipated. Not only is it intellectually stimulating learning new skills, it has also proven to be a fun and sociable experience. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The skills and work-ethic I have developed throughout my degree are surprisingly relevant to coding. I am a strong independent worker with excellent focus, able to conceptualise both the larger 'whole' of a project and the fine levels of detail within. I am quick to grasp new concepts and try to push my understanding beyond what I have been taught. 
    My experience working in groups in roles such as lead teacher, director, and collaborative co-creator, has seen me develop a good range of working practices to streamline workflow and communication in group projects.
