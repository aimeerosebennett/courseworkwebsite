    One of the fundamental benefits of integrating IT systems into business practices is that it makes data entry, collection, and storage much more manageable - these are known as ‘Data Management Systems’ (DMS) <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [1]</a>. Moreover, software that has an accessible and user-friendly interface, especially software uniquely developed for individual business models, is of even greater use to companies as it enables the integration of IT systems into the everyday working practices of every employee without need for highly specialist training. For example, the interface of a cashier’s desk is designed to streamline their operations so that data can be automatically entered and stored in the computer without the need for the cashier to manually write down items and costs using pen and paper - or even enter lines of code/data into a terminal. This thereby reduces the cost of specialist training, increases efficiency and productivity, and provides a safeguard against human error by standardising procedures.

    As technological and internet-based systems continue to streamline commercial processes and fuel globalisation, client/ consumer behaviour trends continue to evolve rapidly. Modern businesses are tasked with gathering data to identify and analyse current market trends, and form strategies to respond to insights gained from this data. This process may be termed ‘reflexive modernity’ <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [2]</a>, and the systems used to carry out these tasks are termed ‘Management Information Systems’ (MIS) <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [1]</a>. Businesses must implement this practice in order to maximise profits and remain current and relevant to their target market(s), to ensure the longevity of the company. The widespread use of databases by businesses, in correlation with the increasingly ubiquitous practice of client data collection, results in companies being able to efficiently carry out data analysis and thereby quickly respond to trends in client/consumer behaviour. The very fact of DMS and MIS being widely used by businesses has furthermore created and sustained demand for tech companies to produce software tailored to businesses’ needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    A further example of how IT systems are used to enhance modern business operations, is ‘Customer Relationship Management’ systems (CRM) <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [1]</a>. CRM systems streamline areas such as complaints, returns, and enquiries by keeping track of each client’s engagement and transactions with the company. The company’s customer relations workforce may then have access to all the information needed to swiftly handle the client interaction and respond with assurance and with minimal delays to any issues that arise.

    When approaching a new project, the most important thing to consider is whether the skills and expertise of the person/team involved, and the resources available to them, are sufficient to meet the brief. When working in a team, it often helps if everyone is comfortable using the same software to ensure each ‘piece’ of the whole will be compatible with the others, and working with the same software can also help to standardise the structure of workflow across the board. When working digitally, one of the biggest barriers to smooth workflow is the incidence of technical problems, which may be due to using ‘outdated’ or inadequate hardware for the task at hand. For example, older laptops may have insufficient cores/ processors, or  insufficient RAM, to carry out tasks that may max-out the CPU, such as video editing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Planning, prioritisation, and delegation of responsibilities is usually the primary phase of any project. If working in a team, establishing functional communication channels will benefit the execution of the planning phase, which requires more negotiation than subsequent phases. If working alone, there is less emphasis on negotiation, but more on planning for effective time management. That said, it is important when working alone to factor in breaks as it is easier to get absorbed in work when you set your own schedule. Experts say that spending time away from the screen when working digitally - especially working from home - can help reduce eye strain, thereby improving wellbeing and productivity <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [3]</a>. Regularly getting up and moving around helps to reduce fatigue by encouraging blood flow, thereby improving energy levels and boosting productivity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Digital resources such as Trello enable both teams and individuals to carry out effective and flexible planning in a ‘kanban’ style, with extra features such as colour-coding, attachments, and due dates. With any project it is helpful to set smaller goals to track progress, which is why the ‘kanban’ style of Trello boards is such a useful resource, as progress-tracking is an integral part of the design.

    I have used Trello to plan out tasks, using the ‘labels’ feature to divide tasks into three colour coded categories. Blue is for writing tasks, which I am carrying out using ‘Pages’, the default word processing program for my MacBook. Yellow is for coding admin/ housekeeping tasks, such as inserting and organising content into HTML pages. Purple is for coding design tasks, which will be completed using CSS. I am using Visual Studio Code to carry out all coding tasks.

    Problems with saving work can result in lost or corrupted files, which can potentially result in losing all progress on a project. This is an issue that has become less common in recent years as modern software integrates features such as ‘autosave’ to mitigate the impact of issues such as crashes or power failures. People who work with computers are also becoming more aware of the importance of backing up work to safeguard against lost or corrupted files.  It is recommended to back up files on separate storage devices such as USB drives/ external hard drives. General knowledge and accessibility of back-up storage solutions has also improved in recent years with the increased popularity of cloud storage/ remote applications such as Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and iCloud <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [4]</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    A pertinent issue with remote digital working is that there is a heavy reliance on good internet connections. Issues with internet connectivity results in impaired access to a vast resource that could be essential for research, trouble-shooting and access to file storage. In the case of website developers, internet is essential for designing and previewing online content. A lack of internet access during a digital project could also have severely negative repercussions for  the business if communications with team members and clients is inhibited.

    Primarily, I would consider which programs/ online applications I feel most comfortable using, as this will play to my strengths and likely produce the best results. If I have identified that the software I currently possess does not cover the needs of the brief, I would then research appropriate programs, taking into consideration three main factors: ease of use/ interface design, professionalism of end products, and compatibility with my chosen operating system (i.e. Mac OS 10.15.7) - and hardware constraints, based on reading product specifications, reviews, and forum discussions online. For example, if I needed to colour grade 4k video footage, native apps such as iMovie are very easy to use but wouldn’t produce a sufficiently professional result. Whereas programs such as DaVinci Resolve, a free - yet professional standard - editing and colour correction program, would be a much more appropriate choice.

    Using Trello has enabled me to streamline the planning phase and keep track of my progress, which has had a positive impact on my productivity. Making use of the ‘labels’ system to colour code tasks enables me to instantly identify the category of tasks that need doing, which is helpful for me as it means I can factor in a need for variety in the working day by  opting to select a task with a different coloured label when deciding what to do next.
    <br>
    <br>
    One issue I had when planning was that I was not initially made aware of all elements of the project, therefore had to adjust priorities and add new cards to include new information as it was provided to me. However, it is a reflection of the usefulness of systems such as Trello that they offer users the flexibility to make changes on-the-fly. If I had been planning with paper and pen, I would have had to tear it up and start afresh, but thanks to using IT systems I was able to adapt to changes with minimal disruption to my workflow.

    For most businesses, GDPR guidelines ought not to be a barrier to operations. Essentially, the guidelines state that when businesses collect personal data from individuals they should do so in a way that is consensual, transparent and confidential. Data should only be acquired, stored, and used for legitimate purposes. Any data collected should represent the minimum amount necessary to fulfil these purposes, and held only for as long as necessary. The individual’s rights include the right to request access to their personal data, to withdraw consent to data storage, to be notified about security breaches that may impact the confidentiality of their data, and the right to object to data processing for direct marketing. Companies must comply with business guidelines and respect and uphold the rights of individuals. <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank"> [5, 6]</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    "The GDPR sets out seven key principles:" 
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</li>
        <li>Purpose limitation</li>
        <li>Data minimisation</li>
        <li>Accuracy</li>
        <li>Storage limitation</li>
        <li>Integrity and confidentiality</li>
        <li>Accountability</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    From the Information Commissioner's Office (Online)<a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[6]</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    The principles are simple and reasonable; they exist to protect individuals and companies from misuse of personal data. Hence why the penalty for non-adherence is so severe:  “infringements of the basic principles for processing personal data are subject to the highest tier of administrative fines. This could mean a fine of up to €20 million, or 4% of your total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.” <a class="link" href="References.html" target="_blank">[5]</a>
