<h3>2.1</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
    The tools I am using (Trello, VS Code, Pages) have worked seamlessly, and any issues encountered are simply a result of my own human error. I am therefore satisfied with the selection of tools I have chosen to use. In terms of planning, I still use my pen and notebook to jot down rough notes. For example, when checking over the ‘live’ website I may be specifically reviewing menu design and functionality, but notice that a content paragraph's formatting has a couple of inconsistencies. I jot down a reminder to fix this, to come back to later. I feel that small notes such as this would cause clutter on Trello and moreover, take longer to write down, therefore analogue methods are an appropriate supplement to my process.

    The tools I have chosen to use seem to be appropriate for the level at which I am working. Perhaps in the future, once my skills have advanced, I will notice the limitations of the programs I am using and seek out alternative solutions recommended by professionals. However, for the task at hand and my current level of understanding, VS Code, Pages, and Trello are entirely appropriate.

    I have opted for a simple colour scheme and layout, in order to focus on functionality first and foremost, and then add layers of complexity if I have enough time, ideas, and code. I started off with a simple concept for the design (monochrome background, with muted contrasting colours for menu bars), influenced by colourful brutalist architecture. There is a playful contrast of soft and hard throughout, which for me feels ‘on brand’; concurrent with the work I make in other mediums. 
    <br>
    <br>
    One example of how brutalist architecture has influenced my design, is the inclusion of the page indicator bar which sits next to the menu bar. The height of the bar changes according to which page you are on, which I personally like as a playful alternative to a permanently highlighted menu box that indicates what page you are currently viewing. The vertical menu bar and page bar complement the clocktower image, and overall give an abstract impression of a cityscape with towering high-rises and different levels of architecture.
    <br>
    <br>
    The background images are all photos I took using my vintage Jupiter-8 f2 85mm equivalent lens, which produces a soft focus and soft grain pattern, which I think creates a pleasing texture when blown up to the size of my laptop screen. I think it is good to have selected images taken with the same lens for consistency, and this kind of information is not always readily available when selecting free images from the internet. In any case, whether it is photos, code or content, I would always prefer to use my own work as much as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    Overall I am satisfied with the design as I feel it is often wiser to execute a simple design well, than attempt an overly ambitious design that ends up riddled with issues and inconsistencies. That is not to say that I believe my design is without faults and imperfections; only that I know my limitations and have worked well within them.

<h3>2.4</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>
    At this stage in the project I have not yet integrated flex-boxes into the design. This would be the main structural improvement to make. Other improvements include embellishments such as menu bar animation (e.g. could they slide up with staggered timing from the bottom of the page when you first navigate to a new page?). I would also like to add a navigation feature for the references, whereby in-text references do not just navigate to the References page, but to the relevant Reference heading, perhaps with a ‘highlight’ feature.

<p>
    Throughout the process of building and refining my website I have been continually checking pages for consistency of layout and functionality. I conducted checks such as following every link/ button to ensure it redirected me to the right place, and made alterations as necessary. After doing these checks, the website is, for all intents and purposes, a clear, functional, and pleasantly designed directory through the content.
